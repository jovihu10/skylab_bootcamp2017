        <p>Now this is a story all about ho my life got twisted upside down and I'd like to take a minute just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a twon called Bel-Air. In West Philadelphia born and raised on the playground my momma said most of my ays chilling out, maxing and relaxing all cool and all shooting some b-ball outside of school when a couple of guys they were up to no good started making trouble in our neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared, she said your moving in with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air</p>
